# Bike Stores Sales Analysis

**Dataset:** [Bike Store SQL DB](https://shorturl.at/fiDQ8)

## Preview:
The folder named **SQL-Server-Sample-Database** contains the downloaded data. Run **BikeStores Sample Database - create objects** followed by **BikeStores Sample Database - load data** in MS SQL Server Management Studio to load the database.

Based on the problem statement for analysis given below, following query was developed to pull the data from all tables in the database.
```
SELECT
	ord.order_id,
	CONCAT(cus.first_name,' ', cus.last_name) AS 'customers',
	cus.city,
	cus.state,
	ord.order_date,
	SUM(ite.quantity) AS  'total_units',
	SUM(ite.quantity * ite.list_price) AS 'revenue',
	pro.product_name,
	cat.category_name,
	bra.brand_name,
	sto.store_name,
	CONCAT(sta.first_name,' ', sta.last_name) AS 'sales_rep'
FROM sales.orders ord
JOIN sales.customers cus
ON ord.customer_id = cus.customer_id
JOIN sales.order_items ite
ON ord.order_id = ite.order_id
JOIN production.products pro
ON ite.product_id = pro.product_id
JOIN production.categories cat
ON cat.category_id = pro.category_id
JOIN sales.stores sto
ON sto.store_id = ord.store_id
JOIN sales.staffs sta
ON ord.staff_id = sta.staff_id
JOIN production.brands bra
ON pro.brand_id = bra.brand_id
GROUP BY
	ord.order_id,
	CONCAT(cus.first_name,' ', cus.last_name),
	cus.city,
	cus.state,
	ord.order_date,
	pro.product_name,
	cat.category_name,
	bra.brand_name,
	sto.store_name,
	CONCAT(sta.first_name,' ', sta.last_name)
```
Resulting data was imported in MS Excel using a connection to database. It contains 4723 Rows and look like this.
